# Machine-Learning-Trading-Bot
As a financial advisor at a top firm, I enhance algorithmic trading systems using machine learning. I establish a baseline performance, tune the trading algorithm by adjusting parameters, evaluate a new machine learning classifier, and create an evaluation report. Results are summarized in the README.md file with PNG images for analysis.
